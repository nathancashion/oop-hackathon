## Report 1: Cashion Danny MRI Lumbar Spine (2021-06-20)

```
### Patient Information
Name: Cashion, Danny
Date of Study: 6/20/2021
Age: 74 
Sex: Male

Study Comparison
MRI lumbar spine: sagittal T1, T2, and STIR; axial T2 N/A 

Indication Second opinion interpretation

Referring physician: Dr. Nathan Cashion, DC
Study performed at: Sharp Rees-Stealy MRI

## Findings
The alignment and height of the vertebral bodies is grossly intact. Multifocal type 1 Modic endplate
changes (edema) are present involving L1-L4, with scattered areas of type 2 Modic endplate changes
elsewhere. The visualized lower thoracic spinal cord is normal in size, shape, and signal intensity. The
conus medullaris terminates normally at the level of T12/L1. The psoas, paraspinal, and gluteal muscles
are normal in bulk and signal, except for the lower paraspinal muscles which demonstrate extensive fatty
replacement and atrophy. The visualized portion of the kidneys appear normal, however simple renal
cysts are incidentally noted bilaterally. The abdominal aorta has a normal caliber. The imaged region of
the upper sacroiliac joints are unremarkable.

- T12/L1: Severe disc height loss with mild circumferential disc bulge and mild facet hypertrophy.
Mild bilateral neuroforaminal narrowing. Minimal central spinal canal stenosis.
- L1/L2: Mild disc height loss and disc desiccation with mild circumferential disc bulge, mild facet
hypertrophy and ligament flavum thickening. Mild bilateral neuroforaminal stenosis. Mild central
canal stenosis.
- L2/L3: Severe disc height loss, hyperintense fluid signal within the disc, and with large
circumferential disc bulge. Moderate bilateral facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum
thickening. Severe neuroforaminal stenosis on the left, moderate on the right. Moderate central
canal stenosis.
- L3/L4: Severe disc height loss, hyperintense fluid signal within the disc, and circumferential disc
bulge with a posterior annular tear containing fat. Extreme facet hypertrophy on the left,
moderate on the right with severe ligamentum flavum thickening. Severe neuroforaminal stenosis
on the left, mild to moderate on the right. Severe central canal stenosis.
- L4/L5: L4 decompressive laminectomy with fusion of the bilateral facets which are hypertrophied.
Mild neuroforaminal stenosis on the left, no stenosis on the right. Disc desiccation and moderate
disc height loss, without bulge or herniation. No central spinal canal narrowing.
- L5/S1: Normal disc signal with small posterior bulge. Severe facet hypertrophy on the right which
appears fused to the sacrum, moderate facet hypertrophy on the left, both of which contact the
transiting S1 nerve root. Mild neuroforaminal stenosis bilaterally, mild central canal stenosis.

## Impressions
1. Severe central canal stenosis at L3/L4, moderate at L2/L3, and mild elsewhere as described above.
Date of Report: 8/16/2021

2. Neuroforaminal stenosis: severe on the left at L3/L4 and L2/L3, moderate on the right at these
levels, and mild elsewhere.
3. Degenerative Type I Modic endplate changes (edema) L1-L4, with associated fluid signal within the
L2-L4 discs likely related to chronic fissures.
4. Compression of the bilateral transiting S1 nerve roots secondary to degenerative facet
hypertrophy at L5/S1.
5. Prior decompressive laminectomy at L4, with no definite associated complication, however there
is fatty atrophy of the paraspinal muscles caudal to this site.

## Report 2: XR Cx 2-3 View FlexExt (2025-09-11)

```
Report
Patient Name: CASHION, DANNY 
Patient ID: 100654923
Date of Birth: 1946-08-26
Accession Number: 03250911010824
Procedure: XR SPINE CERVICAL 2-3 VIEWS + FLEX/EXT
Referring Physician: MA, VINCENT
Study Date & Time: 2025-09-11 3:21 PM
Institution Name: RSR

## RADIOLOGY REPORT FINDINGS

CERVICAL SPINE 8 VIEWS INCLUDING FLEXION AND EXTENSION
Compared with 4/30/2024.
### FINDINGS
Disc space loss, subchondral sclerosis, and marginal osteophytes extend from C1-C2 and then from
C3-C7 levels, accompanied by diffuse apophyseal joint arthrosis. Anterior flowing osteophytic
spurring is compatible with DISH, mildly progressive. This degree of bony hypertrophy could
contribute to dysphagia. Anterior bridging osteophytes have essentially fused the cervical
spine. Slight anterolisthesis of C3 on 4 on a degenerative basis without significant change at
this level on flexion and extension maneuver.

Atlantoaxial joint is hypertrophied and indistinct. Dens is poorly defined. Motion on the
flexion and extension maneuver at this level is suspected. CT scan is recommended for further
evaluation.

### CONCLUSION
1. Progressive severe multilevel degeneration compatible with DISH. Stable anterolisthesis of C3
on 4.
2. Poorly visualized, hypertrophied, and degenerated atlantoaxial joint with possible motion on
flexion and extension maneuver. CT scan is recommended for further evaluation on an urgent
basis. Discussed with Dr. Ma.

CT CERVICAL SPINE WO IV CONTRAST MA, VINCENT
Study Date & Time Institution Name
2025-09-20 8:38 AM RMM
RADIOLOGY REPORT
FINDINGS
FINDING
CT CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST:
TECHNIQUE: Volumetric helical CT images through the cervical spine were obtained without
intravenous contrast with multiplanar reconstruction performed. This exam was performed using
dose optimization techniques including automated exposure control, adjustment of mA and/or kV
according to patient size, and/or iterative reconstruction.
COMPARISON: 9/11/2025, 5/30/2024
FINDINGS:
There is a large corticated ossicle at the tip of the odontoid and there is an expansile cystic
appearance of the mid to inferior posterior body of the odontoid with hypertrophic soft tissue,
also chronic in appearance, but progressed from May 2024 comparison. Resultant mild narrowing at
the craniocervical junction. No basilar invagination. There is widening of the anterior
atlantodental articulation which measures just over 4 mm in AP thickness. Resultant 3 to 4 mm
anterolisthesis of the posterior arch of C1. Background of advanced degenerative changes at the
C1-C2 articulation and mild to moderate degenerative change at the occiput C1 articulation,
greater on the left. The vertebral bodies are maintained in height. There is grade 1
anterolisthesis at C3 on C4 and C7 on T1 which appears to be due to facet degeneration. Bulky
endplate osteophytes are present at C4-T2 without osseous bridging. There is severe hypertrophic
facet arthrosis throughout with a left-sided predominance. No
gross paravertebral collection or soft tissue gas within the limitations of a noncontrast
assessment. Atherosclerotic calcifications at the carotid bifurcations and visualized portion of
the proximal right subclavian. The airway is patent. There is chronic sclerosis and partial
opacification of the visualized portion of the left mastoid tip.
C2/C3: Mild to moderate disc height loss with a circumferential disc bulge. Left-sided
uncovertebral spurring. Severe hypertrophic facet degeneration on the left. Right neural foramen
appears grossly patent. There is severe left osseous neuroforaminal stenosis.
C3/C4: Moderate disc height loss with a sizable circumferential disc osteophyte complex and

ligamentum flavum redundancy which causes likely moderate canal stenosis. There is bilateral
uncovertebral spurring and bilateral severe hypertrophic facet arthrosis with moderate right and
severe left osseous neuroforaminal narrowing.
C4/C5: Moderate disc height loss with a sizable circumferential disc osteophyte complex which
predominates anteriorly. Spinal canal stenosis appears overall mild in conjunction with
ligamentum flavum redundancy. Bilateral uncovertebral spurring. Mild to moderate right and
severe hypertrophic left facet degeneration. At least moderate bilateral osseous neuroforaminal
stenosis.
C5/C6: Mild to moderate disc height loss with a small to moderate circumferential disc
osteophyte complex. Spinal canal stenosis appears overall mild. Bilateral uncovertebral spurring
and advanced hypertrophic facet arthrosis with moderate right and mild to moderate left osseous
neuroforaminal narrowing.
C6/C7: Severe disc height loss with a sizable circumferential disc osteophyte complex. There is
at least moderate canal stenosis in conjunction with ligamentum flavum redundancy. Significant
bilateral uncovertebral spurring and left greater than right advanced hypertrophic facet
arthrosis. Moderate right and moderate to severe left osseous neuroforaminal stenosis.
C7/T1: Moderate to severe disc height loss with a sizable circumferential disc osteophyte
complex. At least moderate canal stenosis in conjunction with ligamentum flavum redundancy.
Bilateral uncovertebral spurring and advanced hypertrophic facet arthrosis. Mild to moderate
bilateral neuroforaminal stenosis.
IMPRESSION:
Chronic hypertrophic fragmented and cystic appearance of the odontoid with pannus. While
findings may be degenerative, underlying inflammatory arthropathy is also a consideration.
Large corticated ossicle at the tip of the odontoid may be sequelae of remote prior trauma or
possibly due to an os odontoideum.
Advanced degenerative changes at the C1-C2 articulation with abnormal widening of the anterior
atlantodental interval and grade 1 anterolisthesis.
Advanced disc, osseous, and facet degeneration throughout the cervical spine, as detailed above.
Bulky anteriorly directed osteophytes at C4-T2, likely due to diffuse idiopathic skeletal
hyperostosis. Of note, the there is not fusion at these levels, as was suggested on the prior
radiograph.
