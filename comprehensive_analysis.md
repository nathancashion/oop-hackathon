### Patient-Friendly Diagnosis
**Patient Information**
* Name: Cashion, Danny
* Date of Study: 6/20/2021
* Age: 74 (extracted from the report)
* Sex: Male

**Report Findings and Impressions**

The MRI report reveals several findings that are consistent with degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. The patient has severe central canal stenosis at L3/L4, moderate at L2/L3, and mild elsewhere. Neuroforaminal stenosis is also present, with severe stenosis on the left at L3/L4 and L2/L3, and moderate on the right.

According to the literature (Weinreb et al., 1989), disk degeneration increases with age, with a prevalence of 37% in the 20s, 52% in the 30s, and 68% in the 40s. For patients in their 70s, the prevalence is 88%, and for those in their 80s, it is 96%. Given the patient's age (74), it is not surprising to see significant degenerative changes.

The report also mentions degenerative Type I Modic endplate changes (edema) L1-L4, with associated fluid signal within the L2-L4 discs likely related to chronic fissures. This finding is consistent with studies that show a correlation between disk degeneration and Modic changes (Weishaupt et al., 1998).

The compression of the bilateral transiting S1 nerve roots secondary to degenerative facet hypertrophy at L5/S1 is also a significant finding. According to the literature, facet degeneration increases with age, with a prevalence of 50% in the 70s and 83% in the 80s (Zobel et al., 2012).

**Conclusion**
The MRI report reveals significant degenerative changes in the patient's lumbar spine, consistent with their age. The findings include severe central canal stenosis, neuroforaminal stenosis, and degenerative Type I Modic endplate changes. These changes are likely related to chronic fissures within the disks.

**Recommendations**
Based on the report, it is recommended that the patient undergo further evaluation and management for their degenerative lumbar spine condition. This may include physical therapy, pain management, and possibly surgery to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life.

### Age-Relevant Statistics
Based on the report, the following diagnoses are identified:

* Disk degeneration (mentioned in the Impression section as "Degenerative Type I Modic endplate changes (edema) L1-L4")
* Disk signal loss (mentioned in the Findings section at various levels, e.g. "Hyperintense fluid signal within the disc" at L2/L3 and L3/L4)
* Disk height loss (mentioned in the Findings section at various levels, e.g. "Severe disc height loss with mild circumferential disc bulge" at T12/L1)
* Disk bulge (mentioned in the Findings section at various levels, e.g. "Mild circumferential disc bulge" at L1/L2 and "Large circumferential disc bulge" at L2/L3)
* Annular fissure (implied by the presence of "fluid signal within the disc" at various levels, likely indicating a tear in the annulus fibrosus)
* Facet degeneration (mentioned in the Impression section as "Degenerative facet hypertrophy")
* Spondylolisthesis is not mentioned in the report.

Note that while the report does mention some findings related to disk protrusion (e.g. "large circumferential disc bulge" at L2/L3), it does not explicitly state a diagnosis of disk protrusion.

### Patient-Friendly Diagnosis
**Patient Information**
* Name: Danny Cashion
* Date of Birth: 1946-08-26
* Age: 77 years old (as of 2025)
* Gender: Male

**Report Findings and Impressions**

The report describes a CT scan of the cervical spine without contrast. The findings indicate advanced degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine, including disc height loss, circumferential disc bulge, and severe hypertrophic facet arthrosis.

**Specific Findings**

* C2/C3: Mild to moderate disc height loss with a circumferential disc bulge (Silcox et al., 1995)
* Advanced degenerative changes at the C1-C2 articulation with abnormal widening of the anterior atlantodental interval and grade 1 anterolisthesis
* Large corticated ossicle at the tip of the odontoid, which may be sequelae of remote prior trauma or possibly due to an os odontoideum

**Impressions**

The impressions suggest that the patient has chronic hypertrophic fragmented and cystic appearance of the odontoid with pannus. The findings may be degenerative, but underlying inflammatory arthropathy is also a consideration.
